# BrowserCache
* Modern web browsers use caching to reduce load times and improve user experience.
* Simulate a browser cache that stores the last N visited web pages.
* Implement LRU (Least Recently Used) caching policy to evict the least-used page.
 * Analyse hit/miss rates for different cache sizes.
